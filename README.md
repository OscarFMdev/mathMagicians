# Math Magicians

"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

Make simple calculations.
Read a random math-related quote.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Built With

- React
- JSX
- CSS

## Live Demo

Not yet available [we are working on it](https://giphy.com/gifs/reactionseditor-cat-typing-ule4vhcY1xEKQ)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
To get a local copy, you should have installed a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
### Setup
To setup a local copy, you should open a terminal in the directory you want to clone this project and run:
``` git clone git@github.com:OscarFMdev/mathMagicians.git ```
### Install
After setting the project, now you should run ``` npm install ``` this will download all the dependecies needed for run this project.

### Usage
This is a Single Page Application, so you could navigate this App by clicking on the different sections in the navigation bar.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
### Run tests
To run the test you could run the command ```npm run test```
### Deployment
For deployment you could run the command ```npm run dev``` this will give you a port where the project is deployed and the you should copy and paste in your favorite browser.
